		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<img class="profile-img" src="images/IMG_3610.jpg" title="profile image">

		
		<p>I am a PhD Candidate in political science at <a href="http://pol.umontreal.ca/recherche/portraits-etudiants/portrait/alison-smith/" target="_blank">l'Universit&eacute de Montr&eacuteal</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.alainnoel.ca/" target="_blank">Alain No&eumll</a>. Prior to starting to PhD programme in 2011 I was a <a href="https://pip-psp.org/home" target="_blank">Parliamentary Intern </a> in Ottawa, where I worked for a government and then an opposition Member of Parliament. I also have an MA in political science from <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">UBC</a>, a BA in political science from <a href="http://www.mta.ca/programs/polisci/" target="_blank"> Mount Allison University</a>, and completed the International Baccalaureate programme at <a href="http://www.pearsoncollege.ca/" target="_blank"> Pearson College</a> in 2005.</p>

		<p>My interests include travelling in Canada, Latin America and Africa; reading fiction; spending time outdoors; and searching for a better cup of coffee. I have many homes, including Westbank BC, Sackville NB, Montr&eacuteal QC, and Ottawa ON. I love Chris Hadfield, elections, and strong mayors.</p>

			<h2>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h2>
			<p>My PhD research compares local responses to homelessness in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montr&eacuteal. Broader research and teaching interests include Canadian politics, social policy and urban governance. </p>
			<p>In the absence of a comprehensive federal and in most cases provincial response to homelessness, the local level is the source of significant policy leadership in responses to homelessness. But homelessness is governed very differently in each of these four cities; I ask what explains the difference in responses to homelessness, and consider what consequences this has for social protection in Canada. Through over 70 semi-structured interviews with actors direclty involved in ending homelessness in Canada, I find that an important factor that shapes the governance network of homelessness is the problem defition of homelessness at the local level.</p>
